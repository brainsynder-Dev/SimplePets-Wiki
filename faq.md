# FAQ

## **Will the Ender Dragon be added to the plugin?**

I personally wont be adding it to the plugin but if someone else adds it via GitHub [Pull Request](https://github.com/brainsynder-Dev/SimplePets/compare) it might be another story

## **What version should I use for my server?**

It depends on what version your server is running. Minecraft Version:

* [Any Version above 1.18.1](https://ci.pluginwiki.us/job/SimplePets\_v5/)

## How can I install addons for SimplePets

Here is the main way of installing addons for SimplePets:

1. Run the <mark style="color:red;">`/pet addon`</mark> command
2. Click the <mark style="color:red;">`Install Addons`</mark> item that is on the last row
3. Click the addon you would like to install _<mark style="color:green;">(Some of them have plugin requirements)</mark>_
4. Re-Open the <mark style="color:red;">`/pet addon`</mark> GUI and make sure the installed addon is enabled (green)&#x20;

<mark style="color:orange;">**--- IF it is still red check your console for an error message ---**</mark>

## My World Guard flags do not seem to be working!

There could be a major reason for this, in v5 of SimplePets we split all external plugin links into their own addons.&#x20;

What you could do is make sure you have the World Guard addon installed on your server (Check <mark style="color:red;">`/pet addon`</mark>)

If the addon is not installed you can follow the steps listed [HERE](faq.md#how-can-i-install-addons-for-simplepets)

## How can I update the addons I have installed?

Currently there is not an easy way to do this, You could update them 2 ways...

1. Download them an manually from either our [JENKINS](https://ci.pluginwiki.us/view/SimplePets%20Addons/) or from the [Addon Site](https://pluginwiki.us/addons/) Then drop them into the <mark style="color:red;">`plugins/SimplePets/Addons`</mark> folder and restart your server
2. The second way is to delete the Addons jar file from the <mark style="color:red;">`plugins/SimplePets/Addons`</mark> folder then re-install them from following the [STEPS HERE](faq.md#how-can-i-install-addons-for-simplepets)
